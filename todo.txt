To do:
Change the world pixel view so things looks porportional and are easier to draw. i think 16 by 16 pixels   Stardew esq
transitions between the screens like a fade thang
build an in game menu for the character.
get boss monster
Npc with chat box( npc movement optional)
a new game is created when using the title screen from game over
same player across maps
title screen code back
more controller code (pause screen, dialog boxes. )

bugs:
overworld music plays everywhere(side effect of the sound class?)
enemies can push you through objects and temp off the map. 
taking damage


Polish:
loot table
enemies drop gold, player can pick it up. 
face direction of shooting
shoot magic from hand ish location.
enemies respawn when entering screen again( load new scene?)
