To do:
Change the world pixel view so things looks porportional and are easier to draw. i think 16 by 16 pixels   Stardew esq
transitions between the screens like a fade thang
build an in game menu for the character.
get boss monster
Npc with chat box( npc movement optional)
a new game is created when using the title screen from game over
same player across maps
Collision

bugs:
Can't shoot and walk diag upleft ( keyboard only)
overworld music plays everywhere(side effect of the sound class?)
